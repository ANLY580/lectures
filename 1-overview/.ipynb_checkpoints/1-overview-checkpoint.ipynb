In addition to basic cognitive capacity, language must be learned early in childhood and is also deeply entwined with culture and convention.\n",

There may be two ways in which we process words (or phrases) in the brain. Dual process theory provides an account for thought arising from both the unconscious (fast) and controlled (slow).

But estimating whether a car looks cheap or expensive involves a more heuristic process and judgement is largely formed through unconscious processes.\n",

    "The same may be true of language. Function words are largely grammaticalized information accessible via unconscious processes. Indeed, when you first learn a new language it is effortful to form utterances and later becomes much easier as unconscious processes assimilate patterns at different levels of analysis. Yet, you still make conscious choices about the words you might use to frame your thoughts, depending on the audience. And despite this, you would not expend much energy thinking about whether to insert smaller, grammaticalized pieces of information. Your ability to use such information is largely driven by unconscious processes. In fact, our brains are quite efficient in the use of language using as little effort as possible."
