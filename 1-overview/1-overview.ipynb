    "More than 6ooo human languages today. 94% of the world's language account for only 6% of the world's population.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no clear distinction between a language and dialect. Languages tend to be grouped sociopolitically and also in terms of mutual intelligibility, writing systems, geography, and culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, language is a *social* phenomenon. What makes human language unique from other forms of animal communication is it's *productivity* (i.e.,, generative nature) and it's *expressiveness.* Theoretical linguistics has long sought to tease out universal principles that underlie all human language. In addition to basic cognitive capacity, language must be learned early in childhood and is also deeply entwined with culture and convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is inherently social, language use is variable -- crossing social boundaries, conventional use across media, and over time. In fact, language changes very quickly - and especially where different cultures contact one another. Because language is so variable, it poses particular challenges for language processing."

    "A possible explanation for this distribution is accounted for by dual process theory, as described by Kahneman (2010). There may be two ways in which we process words (or phrases) in the brain. Dual process theory provides an account for thought arising from both the unconscious (fast) and controlled (slow). The multiplication of two three digit numbers in one’s head  involves the use of working memory and planning circuitry. But estimating whether a car looks cheap or expensive involves a more heuristic process and judgement is largely formed through unconscious processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same may be true of language. Function words are largely grammaticalized information accessible via unconscious processes. Indeed, when you first learn a new language it is effortful to form utterances and later becomes much easier as unconscious processes assimilate patterns at different levels of analysis. Yet, you still make conscious choices about the words you might use to frame your thoughts, depending on the audience. And despite this, you would not expend much energy thinking about whether to insert smaller, grammaticalized pieces of information. Your ability to use such information is largely driven by unconscious processes. In fact, our brains are quite efficient in the use of language using as little effort as possible."
