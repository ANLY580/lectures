    "\"We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to produce, and then empirically validate, a gold-standard sentiment lexicon that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts. We next combine these lexical features with consideration for five generalizable rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions that humans use when expressing or emphasizing sentiment intensity.\"\n",

For example, “The food here is GREAT!” conveys more intensity than “The food here is great!”\n",
    "3. **Degree modifiers (also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity.** For example, “The service here is extremely good” is more intense than “The service here is good”, whereas “The service here is marginally good” reduces the intensity. \n",
    "4. **The contrastive conjunction “but” signals a shift in sentiment polarity, with the sentiment of the text following the conjunction being dominant.** “The food here is great, but the service is horrible” has mixed sentiment, with the latter half dictating the overall rating.\n",
    "5. By examining the **tri-gram preceding a sentiment-laden lexical feature, we catch nearly 90% of cases where negation flips the polarity of the text.** A negated sentence would be “The food here isn’t really all that great”.\n"
