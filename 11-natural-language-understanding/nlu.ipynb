    "Recap from last week:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguists tend to think of language processing and NLP in terms of levels of abstraction. This is a fairly typical perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When you decode language in your brain, it comes in as sounds and is mapped to **phonemes** (which are themselves abstractions, though also perceptual entities). \n",
    "- The smallest unit of meaning is a **morpheme**, and morphemes can be combined into larger structure such as words. \n",
    "    - A good example are English prefixes and suffixes such as \"intra-\" (e.g., inward; intraspective) and \"-tion\" (e.g., investigation; property of being a noun or a nominalization). Note that the suffix grammaticizes meaning.\n",
    "- Words are articulated in sequences that align to **syntactic structures** with properties such as nesting and recursion. \n",
    "    - This means we can say things like \"the old old building\" or longer structures such as \"the guy who you saw last week who had the big floppy hat and who bumped into us during the intermission.\"\n",
    "- Movement of words in a sequence result in meaning change. Last week we looked at wh-fronting where question words look like sentences where a nominal moves up to the front of a sentence in order to change from an assertion to a question.\n",
    "- And, finally **meaning is NOT just the sum compositional meaning of words in a sequence, but is enriched by other representations in the world** (e.g., the visual world), convention, and how the speaker intends to produce an utterance and have it understood. \n",
    "\n",
    "This last problem becomes incredibly important when we talk about context that extends beyond a sentence and we'll look at that more closely today."
