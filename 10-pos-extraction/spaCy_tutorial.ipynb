    "# Natural Language in Python Using spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "This project complements the [article](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/natural-language-in-python-using-spacy/) on the Domino Data Science blog. The article provides a brief introduction to natural language using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and related libraries in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a brief introduction to working with natural language (sometimes called \"text analytics\") in Python using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and related libraries. Data science teams in industry must work with lots of text, one of the top four categories of data used in machine learning. Usually it's human-generated text, but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it: how does the \"operating system\" for business work? Typically, there are contracts (sales contracts, work agreements, partnerships), there are invoices, there are insurance policies, there are regulations and other laws, and so on. All of those are represented as text. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may run across a few acronyms: _natural language processing_ (NLP), _natural language understanding_ (NLU), _natural language generation_ (NLG)—which are roughly speaking \"read text\", \"understand meaning\", \"write text\" respectively. Increasingly these tasks overlap and it becomes difficult to categorize any given feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _spaCy_ framework—along with a wide and growing range of plug-ins and other integrations—provides features for a wide range of natural language tasks. It's become one of the most widely used natural language libraries in Python for industry use cases, and has quite a large community—and with that, much support for commercialization of research advances as this area continues to evolve rapidly."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Five years ago, if you’d asked about open source in Python for natural language, a default answer from many people working in data science would've been [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).\n",
    "That project includes just about everything but the kitchen sink and has components which are relatively academic.\n",
    "Another popular natural language project is [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) from Stanford.\n",
    "Also quite academic, albeit powerful -- though _CoreNLP_ can be challenging to integrate with other software for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a few years ago everything in this corner of the world began to change.\n",
    "The two principal authors for _spaCy_ -- [Matthew Honnibal](https://twitter.com/honnibal) and [Ines Montani](https://twitter.com/_inesmontani) -- launched the project in 2015, and industry adoption was rapid.\n",
    "They focused on an _opinionated_ approach (do what's needed, do it well, no more, no less) which provided simple, rapid integration into data science workflows in Python, as well as faster execution and better accuracy than the alternatives.\n",
    "Based on those priorities, _spaCy_ become sort of the opposite of _NLTK_.\n",
    "Since 2015, _spaCy_ has consistently focused on being an open source project (i.e., depending on its community for directions, integrations, etc.) and being commercial-grade software (not academic research).\n",
    "That said, _spaCy_ has been quick to incorporate the SOTA advances in machine learning, effectively becoming a conduit for moving research into industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that machine learning for natural language got a big boost during the mid-2000's as Google began to win international language translation competitions.\n",
    "Another big change occurred during 2017-2018 when, following the many successes of _deep learning_, those approaches began to out-perform previous machine learning models.\n",
    "For example, see the [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) work on _language embedding_ by Allen AI, followed by [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) from Google, and more recently [ERNIE](https://medium.com/syncedreview/baidus-ernie-tops-google-s-bert-in-chinese-nlp-tasks-d6a42b49223d) by Baidu -- in other words, the search engine giants of the world have gifted the rest of us with a Sesame Street repertoire of open source embedded language models based on deep learning, which is now _state of the art_ (SOTA).\n",
    "Speaking of which, to keep track of SOTA for natural language, keep an eye on [NLP-Progress](http://nlpprogress.com/) and [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota).\n",
    "\n",
    "The use cases for natural language shifted dramatically over the past two years, after deep learning techniques arose to the fore.\n",
    "Circa 2014, a natural language tutorial in Python might have shown _word count_ or _keyword search_ or _sentiment detection_ and the target use cases were relatively underwhelming.\n",
    "Circa 2019 we're talking about analyzing thousands of documents for vendor contracts in an industrial supply chain optimization ... or hundreds of millions of documents for policy holders of an insurance company, or gazillions of documents regarding financial disclosures. More contemporary natural language work tends to be in NLU, often to support construction of _knowledge graphs,_ and increasingly in NLG where large numbers of similar documents can be summarized at human scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [spaCy Universe](https://spacy.io/universe) is a great place to check for deep-dives into particular use cases, and to see how this field is evolving. Some selections from this \"universe\" include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Blackstone](https://spacy.io/universe/project/blackstone) – parsing unstructured legal texts\n",
    " - [Kindred](https://spacy.io/universe/project/kindred) – extracting entities from biomedical texts (e.g., Pharma)\n",
    " - [mordecai](https://spacy.io/universe/project/mordecai) – parsing geographic information\n",
    " - [Prodigy](https://spacy.io/universe/project/prodigy) – human-in-the-loop annotation to label datasets\n",
    " - [spacy-raspberry](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-raspberry) – Raspberry PI image for running _spaCy_ and deep learning on edge devices\n",
    " - [Rasa NLU](https://spacy.io/universe/project/rasa) – Rasa integration for chat apps\n",
    " \n",
    "There's much more we can do with _spaCy_ – although hopefully this tutorial provides an introduction. We wish you all the best in your natural language work."
